# Examples

I added a VSCode workspace configuration as an example. It is the one I am currently, using, though somewhat modified.

It requires the following extensions :

* [Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf)
* [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright)

I would also advise you to use [Mardown All In One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one).
